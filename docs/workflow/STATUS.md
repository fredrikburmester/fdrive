# Current handoff

Updated: 2026-09-08. Owner: primary agent.

## Workflow simplification (complete)

- Requested changes integrated and verified; baseline `e791fd5`. Three workflow worktrees
  reviewed, byte/mode-verified against target, then removed. Other task worktrees preserved.
- Native optional delegation; compact shared docs/roles; recovery and history loaded on demand.
  Terra/high configuration and explicit Astra/low approval policy preserved.
- Helpers: compact PASS/FAIL with retained logs; Python venv/dev readiness setup; working-tree
  baselines before setup; scoped conflict-safe uncommitted transfer with diff/check modes.
  CI shares setup/verification commands and uploads only helper logs on failure.
- Target `workflow` PASS: 32 command +8 environment +19 integration-helper +11 transfer
  regression groups; shell/Python/TOML syntax, lint, diff checks. CI YAML and docs links pass.
- Real core profile PASS: 292 tests, existing coverage intact. Quiet89 vs verbose1611 bytes
  (94.5% less output); shared docs/roles ~60% fewer words. Evidence in ignored
  `.fdrive-workflow/evaluation/`; full gate logs under `.fdrive-workflow/logs/`.
- Hosted CI not run locally; new role text takes effect when the runtime reloads configuration.
  Dev lifecycle tested with fixtures and occupied-port smoke; existing live servers preserved.

## Search startup recovery (2026-09-08)

- User requested automatic recovery after deployment without page reload.
- Implementer completed search contracts/API/UI/tests in `.worktrees/search-startup-recovery`,
  branch `codex/search-startup-recovery`; baseline committed HEAD, no copied prerequisites.
- Add transient scope reason and bounded polling while open; preserve scope authorization.
- Reviewed scope and production diff; committed as `af0a3d9` after user requested commit/push.
- Live dev verification: stopped local `fdrive-dev-indexer-1`, observed startup message;
  restarted indexer and saw text plus visual results for unchanged `readme` query without reload.
- Workflow, target application (lint/typecheck/coverage), and integration passed.
- Target search browser suite passed 17/17, including startup message and unchanged-query
  recovery. Logs: `/tmp/fdrive-startup-{application-final,integration,browser-final}.log`.
- Complete. Worker checkout removed after exact file comparison and target gates.
  Unrelated concurrent workflow changes preserved.

## Product state

- Latest search/file-browser UX merged and verified; no outstanding UX work. Prior target
  application/workflow gates passed and affected browser suite passed 31/31.
- Phase 5 strict performance gate previously passed: search25k p95 195.82 ms (<300),
  zero errors; detailed evidence in archive.
- Earlier P5 worktrees were retained by the preceding task. Do not clean them without review.
- Full prior evidence, performance work, and historical handoffs: [archive](STATUS-history.md).
  Product scope and architecture remain in [PLAN.md](../../PLAN.md).
